/* 
----------------OBJECTIVE--------------------
Declare a Checker class that implements 
the comparator method as described. It should 
sort first descending by score, then ascending 
by name. The code stub reads the input, creates
a list of Player objects, uses your method to 
sort the data, and prints it out properly.

class Checker implements Comparator<Player> {
  	// complete this method
	public int compare(Player a, Player b) {
        if(a.score == b.score)
            return a.name.compareTo(b.name); // Sorts the names in ascending order
        return b.score - a.score; // Sorts the scores in descending order
    }
